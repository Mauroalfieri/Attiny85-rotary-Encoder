# Attiny85-rotary-Encoder
The rotary encoder attiny85 combines the micro controller with the encoder to collect data and transfer them via I2C.

The rotary encoder attiny85 is a project that assemble two components:

* the micro controller Attiny85
* a rotary encoder with led

You can read the encoder independently and transmit, the collected, data through the I2C protocol. Otherwise you can control directly a crown of neopixel LEDs from the attiny85 micro controller.

This project have tiny dimension, only 24 x 27 mm, to reduce the sizes of your project and space used.

You can choose and write your properly sketch and upload it on the attiny85 to use directly the rotary encoder attiny85 like a complete project.

You can buy the PCB only on [Tindie][https://www.tindie.com/products/18765/]
